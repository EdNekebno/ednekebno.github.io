	<h2>RIVES Scratch Like Development Enviroment</h2>
  <p>Sometimes I do things just because they're interesting and I want to see if they can be done. For some reason, following RIVES jam #2, I got to wondering if it would be possible to program a rives game using blocks (an approach made famous by scratch)</p>
  <p>So I coded a proof of concept of a blocks based editor. 'proof of concept' is a key phrase here. Currently - if you use it you are almost certainly going to run into bugs and problems. For example, if you RUN a program and you want to type numbers into text boxes then you need to stop
	  the RIVES emulator running as it's grabbed the keys. It's also worth noting that whilst you can make simple games with it and they do actually run on the RIVES emulator,
   there's currently no way to package them into cartridge files (not that that is difficult to code, but because that requires a server, which is a lot of bother for a proof of concept :) ).</p>
  <p>With this blocks based editor: I followed the RIVES tutorial for <a href='https://rives.io/docs/riv/creating-a-game'>Creating a Game</a>, but did it in blocks instead. This ends up with a nice little snake game.</p>
  <p>If I haven't put you off with the description, you can try that with the link below:</p>
